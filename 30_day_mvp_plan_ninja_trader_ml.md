# 30â€‘Day MVP Plan â€“ Machineâ€‘Learning Strategy Deployer for NinjaTraderÂ 8

**Objective**: Build, within 30â€¯days, a minimum viable product (MVP) that can train a machineâ€‘learning model on historical ES mini futures data from NinjaTraderÂ 8, generate trading signals, and automatically place live/sim trades through NinjaTrader.

## Highâ€‘Level Timeline (4Â Weeks)

| Week | Focus | Key Outcomes |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Data & Model Design | Data pipeline finalized, baseline feature set, model architecture decision |
| 2 | Training & Validation | Clean notebook/script that trains & crossâ€‘validates model, walkâ€‘forward backâ€‘test results |
| 3 | Integration | Signal bridge converts model output â†’ NinjaScript, Autoâ€‘trade AddOn operational in sim |
| 4 | Testing & Launch | Endâ€‘toâ€‘end rehearsal on sim & microâ€‘live, metrics collected, MVP release checklist signed off |

## Detailed Workâ€‘Plan

### WeekÂ 1 â€“ Data Engineering & Model Selection
1. **Data pipeline**
   * Export 2â€‘5Â years of 1â€‘minute ES data via NTÂ Market Replay API.
   * Store parquet/feather in `/data/es_1m/`.
   * Add derived columns: returns, ATR, EMA9, EMA21, VWAP, timeâ€‘ofâ€‘day, session flags.

2. **Feature engineering**
   * Windowed OHLCV + indicators (Zâ€‘score normalized).
   * Lagged target: `close[t+N] â€“ close[t]` â‰¥ threshold â†’ Long/Short/Flat.

3. **Model architecture decision**
   * Compare:
     * **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** â€“ fast inference, robust.
     * **LightGBM / XGBoost** â€“ tabular, interpretable, lower latency.
   * Criteria: F1 @ 0 cost, Sharpe in walkâ€‘forward, latencyÂ <Â 20â€¯ms.
   * Choose winner for MVP; keep runnerâ€‘up as fallback.

### WeekÂ 2 â€“ Training & Validation
1. **Walkâ€‘forward training**
   * Rolling 6â€‘month train / 1â€‘month test slices (Januaryâ€¯2020Â â†’ Mayâ€¯2025).
   * Hyperâ€‘parameter sweep with Optuna (e.g., 100 trials).

2. **Metrics dashboard**
   * Accuracy, precision, recall, PnL, MaxDD, Sharpe, avg trade duration.
   * Save plots (`/reports/week2/`) & JSON metrics.

3. **Model artifact**
   * Save as `model.pkl` (LightGBM) or `model.onnx` (TCN) in `/models/`.

### WeekÂ 3 â€“ Platform Integration
1. **Signal bridge**
   * Python WebSocket client subscribes to NTÂ AddOn realâ€‘time feed.
   * Converts latest bar into feature vector, runs model, returns `LONG | SHORT | FLAT`.

2. **NinjaScript Strategy wrapper**
   * Receives signals via local TCP/WS.
   * Executes market order size = 1 MES contract; configurable via parameters.

3. **CI/CD skeleton**
   * Git repo w/ GitHub Actions: unit tests, model retrain job, deploy to `/NinjaTrader 8/bin/Custom/Strategies`.

### WeekÂ 4 â€“ Testing, Hardening & Release
1. **Sim tests**
   * 1â€‘week paper trading on NT Sim101; compare live vs backâ€‘test metrics.

2. **Microâ€‘live test**
   * 0.1â€¯MES contract for 2 trading days; monitor slippage & latency.

3. **Risk controls**
   * Max daily loss, max position size, cooldown after 3 consecutive losers.

4. **Documentation & Handoff**
   * README (setup, retrain, deploy).
   * MVP demo video.
   * Go/Noâ€‘Go review.

## Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] `data_pipeline.ipynb` & ETL script  
- [ ] Feature spec & schema  
- [ ] Trained model artifact & metrics report  
- [ ] Signal bridge service (`bridge.py`)  
- [ ] NinjaScript strategy (`MLSignalStrategy.cs`)  
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline file (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)  
- [ ] User guide & demo

## Success Criteria
* Sharpe â‰¥â€¯1.2 on 2024â€‘2025 OOS.
* Sim latency â‰¤â€¯250â€¯ms roundâ€‘trip.
* Endâ€‘toâ€‘end uptime 95â€¯% during test week.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Data gaps / bad ticks | M | H | Daily sanity checks, Kâ€‘nearest fill |
| Overâ€‘fit model | M | H | Walkâ€‘forward, earlyâ€‘stopping |
| WS latency spikes | L | M | Local caching, async queue |
| NT API changes | L | H | Pin NT8 version 8.1.x, smoke tests |

## Nextâ€¯Steps (Today)
1. Create Git repo `nt8â€‘mlâ€‘mvp`.
2. Export 2Â years of ES 1â€¯min data.
3. Spin up Optuna sweep skeleton.
4. Schedule daily 30â€‘min standâ€‘ups.

## Reasoning
We prioritized a **TCN vs LightGBM** bakeâ€‘off because both handle timeâ€‘series well yet keep inference fast enough for intraday execution. A 4â€‘week cadence forces early data + model convergence, leaving the risky platform integration for weekâ€¯3, but still allowing a fullâ€‘week soak test. Walkâ€‘forward prevents lookâ€‘ahead bias, and microâ€‘live reduces capital at risk while exposing realâ€‘time quirks. Deliverables map 1â€‘toâ€‘1 with success criteria, keeping the scope tight and measurable. ðŸš€
