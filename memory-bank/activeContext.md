- Model architecture decision (TCN vs LightGBM)

**Specific Tasks:**
- Export 2-5 years of 1-minute ES data via NT Market Replay API
- Store data in parquet/feather format in `/data/es_1m/`
- Add derived columns: returns, ATR, EMA9, EMA21, VWAP, time-of-day, session flags
- Design feature engineering pipeline with Z-score normalization
- Define lagged target: `close[t+N] â€“ close[t]` â‰¥ threshold â†’ Long/Short/Flat
- Compare TCN vs LightGBM/XGBoost performance
