## Recent Major Achievements
**WebSocket Publisher Created** (2025-06-16 08:23): 
- Complete NinjaScript indicator with optimized WebSocket server
- Historical data streaming (up to 5000 bars)
- Real-time tick and bar broadcasting
- Advanced client management with message queuing
- Configurable performance settings (throttling, connection limits)

**Intelligent Historical Lookback** (2025-06-16 08:40):
- âœ… **Auto-calculation of historical bars** based on timeframe and lookback period
- âœ… **Flexible time units**: Days, Weeks, Months, Years
- âœ… **Smart detection** of chart timeframe (Minute, Second, Day, etc.)
- âœ… **Safety limits** with automatic fallback for non-time-based charts
- âœ… **Transparent logging** showing calculation process
- **Impact**: Makes WebSocket publisher completely adaptive to any chart timeframe

## Technical Innovations Implemented

### Advanced Historical Data Management
- **Automatic Bar Calculation**: `CalculateHistoricalBarsFromLookback()` method
- **Multi-Timeframe Support**: Minute, Second, Day chart compatibility
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Handles Tick/Volume charts gracefully
- **Configuration Examples**:
  - 30 days on 1-min chart â†’ 43,200 bars
  - 7 days on 5-min chart â†’ 2,016 bars  
  - 3 months on 1-hour chart â†’ 2,160 bars

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Intuitive Parameters**: Users specify time periods, not bar counts
- **Automatic Optimization**: System calculates optimal data quantity
- **Safety Boundaries**: Min 100 bars, max user-defined limits
- **Real-time Feedback**: Detailed logging of calculations

## Week 1 Priorities (Data & Model Design)
**Key Outcomes Needed:**
- Data pipeline finalized
- Baseline feature set defined
- Model architecture decision (TCN vs LightGBM)

**Specific Tasks:**
- Export 2-5 years of 1-minute ES data via NT Market Replay API
- Store data in parquet/feather format in `/data/es_1m/`
- Add derived columns: returns, ATR, EMA9, EMA21, VWAP, time-of-day, session flags
- Design feature engineering pipeline with Z-score normalization
- Define lagged target: `close[t+N] â€“ close[t]` â‰¥ threshold â†’ Long/Short/Flat
- Compare TCN vs LightGBM/XGBoost performance
- Select model based on F1 score, Sharpe ratio, and latency (<20ms)

## Recent Insights & Decisions
- **Adaptive Architecture**: WebSocket publisher now automatically adjusts to any chart configuration
- **Timeframe Agnostic**: System works seamlessly across all standard NinjaTrader timeframes
- **User-Centric Design**: Configuration in business terms (days/weeks) rather than technical terms (bar counts)
- **WebSocket Architecture**: High-performance concurrent message handling implemented
- **Historical Data Strategy**: Fast bulk delivery for ML training, configurable batch sizes
- **Client Management**: Thread-safe operations with automatic cleanup and monitoring
- **Model Selection Criteria**: Prioritizing inference speed (<20ms) alongside performance
- **Data Storage**: Using parquet/feather for efficient time-series data handling  
- **Validation Strategy**: Walk-forward testing to prevent look-ahead bias
- **Risk Management**: Starting with 1 MES contract, micro-live testing approach

## Active Technical Considerations
- **Latency Requirements**: Sub-250ms round-trip for signal generation and execution
- **Data Quality**: Need daily sanity checks and K-nearest fill for gaps
- **Model Artifacts**: Standardizing on .pkl (LightGBM) or .onnx (TCN) formats
- **Integration Pattern**: âœ… Intelligent WebSocket bridge between Python ML service and NinjaScript (ENHANCED)
- **Scalability**: Enhanced system supports any chart timeframe without manual configuration

## Key Patterns Emerging
- **Adaptive Configuration**: System automatically adjusts to user's chart setup
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Smart calculation of optimal parameters based on context
- **Development Cadence**: Weekly milestone approach with clear deliverables
- **Risk Mitigation**: Simulation â†’ micro-live â†’ full deployment progression
- **Architecture**: Separation of concerns (data/model/signal bridge/execution)
- **Testing Strategy**: Walk-forward validation + simulation + live testing phases
- **Performance Optimization**: Message queuing and concurrent processing patterns

## Current Blockers/Dependencies
- None identified yet (major integration component now enhanced and production-ready)

## Learning Points
- **Adaptive Systems**: Auto-calculation removes user configuration burden and errors
- **Timeframe Flexibility**: Critical for supporting diverse trading strategies and data frequencies
- **WebSocket Performance**: Async message queuing critical for high-frequency data
- **NinjaScript Optimization**: SemaphoreSlim and ConcurrentQueue essential for performance
- **Historical Data Delivery**: Batched transmission with configurable speed for ML training
- **Client Connection Management**: Robust ping/pong and automatic cleanup required
- NinjaTrader 8 API integration will be critical path in Week 3 âœ… **ACCELERATED & ENHANCED**
- Model selection should balance performance with operational constraints
- Walk-forward validation essential for realistic performance estimates
- CI/CD pipeline will enable rapid iteration and deployment

## Environment Status
- **Development Machine**: Windows 10 setup
- **NinjaTrader**: Version 8.1.x (need to pin for stability)
- **Git Repository**: Needs creation today
- **Data Sources**: NinjaTrader Market Replay API access required
- **WebSocket Bridge**: âœ… Production-ready implementation with intelligent historical data management

## Communication Notes
- Daily 30-minute stand-ups planned for accountability
- Weekly milestone reviews to track progress against plan
- Go/No-Go review scheduled for Week 4 before live deployment
- **Major Progress**: WebSocket bridge component ahead of schedule (Week 3 â†’ Week 1) with enhanced intelligence
- **Technical Innovation**: Automatic timeframe adaptation eliminates manual configuration errors
