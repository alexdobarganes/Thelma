- **10:15** - üßπ **FINAL VALIDATION CLEANUP**: Removed redundant CPU validation implementations
  - **Files Removed**: `quick_walk_forward.py`, `walk_forward_validation.py` (CPU-only versions)

### 2025-06-17T10:40:00Z - Win-Rate Optimization Attempt 1
**FAILED**: Win-rate optimized model using NY high-performance windows
- Win Rate: 39.3% ¬± 3.3% (‚ùå failed to reach 62% target)
- F1 Score: 0.396 ¬± 0.129 (‚ùå regression from enhanced model)
- Sharpe Ratio: -11.75 (‚ùå very negative)
- Identified over-aggressive parameters as root cause

### 2025-06-17T10:45:00Z - NY Time Window Analysis Breakthrough  
**MAJOR DISCOVERY**: NY high-performance windows confirmed highly effective
- 09:00-10:00 NY: 57.9% active rate (best performing window)
- 10:00-11:30 NY: 56.7% active rate (morning volatility)
- 13:30-15:00 NY: 34.2% active rate (preclose positioning)
- +32.1% more active signals in high-perf windows
- +16.0% higher volatility during these periods
- Strategic pivot identified: Hybrid Enhanced + Time Windows approach

### 2025-06-17T10:47:00Z - Failure Analysis & Strategic Pivot
**ANALYSIS COMPLETE**: Root cause analysis of win-rate optimization failure
- Problem: Over-aggressive confidence threshold (0.5 too restrictive)
- Problem: Complex multi-window approach diluted effectiveness  
- Problem: 145 features vs 74 (potential overfitting)
- Solution: Hybrid approach using Enhanced model + best time window only
- Next iteration: Focus on 09:00-10:00 NY window + reduced confidence (0.35)

### 2025-06-17T12:36:00Z - **COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT CLEANUP & OPTIMIZATION**
**MAJOR CLEANUP MILESTONE**: Complete codebase optimization for production readiness

  - `src/data/`: Kept only `feature_engineering_enhanced.py` (working version)
  - `reports/`: Removed 12 experimental directories, kept core model_comparison and comprehensive_comparison

### 2025-06-19T22:40:00Z - üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: Signal Generation Fixed
**BREAKTHROUGH**: Complete resolution of signal generation system failure
- **Problem Diagnosed**: After 985 minutes of operation, system received 97MB of data but generated ZERO signals
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 3 critical bugs in V-reversal pattern detection logic:
  1. **Trading Window Conflict**: Launcher configured session 9:25-13:30 but detector has windows 3-4 AM, 9-11 AM, 1:30-3 PM
  2. **Pattern Scanning Range Bug**: Detector only scanned last 30 bars instead of all available bars
  3. **Recency Requirement Too Strict**: Required pullback within last 2 bars instead of reasonable timeframe
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  1. Updated launcher sessions to 3:00-15:00 to cover all production windows
  2. Changed pattern scanning from `range(max(0, n-30), n-drop_window)` to `range(0, n-drop_window)`
  3. Relaxed recency requirement from `pullback_idx < n-2` to `pullback_idx < n-10`
- **Validation Results**: 14 patterns detected in test, signal files generated successfully
- **Production Impact**: $2300/day model now properly generating signals during production windows
- **System Status**: ‚úÖ Signal generation fully operational

### 2025-06-20T08:50:00Z - üïê **TIMESTAMP SYNCHRONIZATION BREAKTHROUGH**
**CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved timestamp mismatch between system time and data time
- **Problem Identified**: Both detector and AutoTrader using system time instead of data timestamps
  - Detector: Used `datetime.now()` for trading window validation
  - AutoTrader: Used current system time for trading hours check
  - Result: Valid signals rejected as "after hours" when data was within trading windows
- **Solution - Detector**: Modified to use `latest_bar['timestamp'].astimezone(eastern_tz)` for window validation
- **Solution - AutoTrader**: Added `PlaybackMode` parameter to parse timestamps from signal filenames
- **Timestamp Parsing**: Format `vreversal_20250213_135900.txt` ‚Üí `2025-02-13 13:59:00 ET`
- **Validation**: 13:59 ET data correctly accepted within 1:30-3 PM trading window
- **Impact**: System now correctly processes signals based on market data timestamps, not system time

### 2025-06-20T09:00:00Z - üö´ **SIGNAL DUPLICATION ELIMINATED**  
**CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved duplicate signal generation for identical patterns
- **Problem Diagnosed**: Same V-reversal patterns generating multiple signals with different IDs
  - Root cause: `signal_id = f"{int(time.time())}"` created unique IDs for identical patterns
  - Evidence: `vreversal_20250213_135900.txt` generated multiple times with different SIGNAL_IDs
  - System impact: AutoTrader processing same trade multiple times
- **Solution Implemented**: Deterministic signal ID generation based on pattern characteristics
  ```python
  # Before (PROBLEMATIC):
  signal_id = f"{int(time.time())}"  # Always unique, causes duplicates
  
  # After (DETERMINISTIC):
  pattern_time_str = pattern_timestamp.strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S") 
  signal_id = f"{pattern_time_str}_{origin_high:.2f}_{df.at[low_idx, 'low']:.2f}"
  # Example: "20250213_135900_6107.25_6091.50"
  ```
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Same patterns now generate identical signal_id = processed once only
- **System Validation**: No more duplicate trades for identical patterns
- **Impact**: Clean signal processing - each unique pattern processed exactly once

### 2025-06-20T09:10:00Z - ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL**
**MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Complete end-to-end trading system operational

- 2025-06-17T11:04:25Z - **Enhanced + CORRECT Windows model (10:00-11:30, 13:00-15:30 NY) completed: 41.5% win rate (FAILED -9.4% vs Enhanced baseline)**

## Major Events

- 2025-06-17T09:00:00Z - Week 2 win-rate optimization phase initiated (target: 62%+ win rate)
- 2025-06-17T09:32:00Z - NY Windows validation analysis completed (585K+ samples confirmed hypothesis)
- 2025-06-17T10:22:29Z - Enhanced + Golden Hour strategy FAILED (complex approach)
- 2025-06-17T10:40:00Z - Enhanced Optimized strategy FAILED (minimal approach)
- 2025-06-17T10:44:52Z - Enhanced EXACT Replica strategy FAILED (hyperparameter correction)
- 2025-06-17T11:04:25Z - **Enhanced + CORRECT Windows strategy FAILED (correct 10:00-11:30, 13:00-15:30 NY windows)**

## Critical Discoveries

- Enhanced model baseline reproducibility issues identified
- Trading windows correction (10:00-11:30, 13:00-15:30) did NOT resolve systematic failure
- Systemic ~41-42% win rate ceiling across ALL recent model variants
- Problem confirmed as deeper than hyperparameters or trading windows
