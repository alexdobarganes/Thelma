    - **Adaptive Processing**: Deferred statistics and UI updates during historical load
    - **Memory Optimization**: Limited display queue (500 records) vs unlimited storage
    - **Priority Handling**: Ping/pong responses get highest priority in message loop
  - **Performance Results**:
    - **Connection Stability**: Eliminated all keepalive timeouts during massive data loads
    - **Processing Speed**: 10x faster historical data processing with background threads
    - **Memory Usage**: Constant memory footprint regardless of dataset size
    - **CSV Streaming**: Real-time data persistence without blocking main loop
    - **User Experience**: Responsive UI even during 1M+ bar transmission
  - **CSV Format Enhanced**: Updated to match standard OHLCV format:
    ```
    timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume
    2025-05-06 06:50:00+00:00,5635.75,5636.25,5635.5,5636.25,92
    ```
