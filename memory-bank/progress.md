# Progress: NinjaTrader 8 ML Strategy Deployer

## Current Status: Advanced Platform Integration
**Overall Progress**: 30% (Memory bank established, Git repository created, intelligent WebSocket bridge completed)
**Week**: Week 1 - Data & Model Design (with enhanced Week 3 component done)
**Next Milestone**: Complete data pipeline and model selection

## What Works ✅

### Planning & Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive 30-day MVP plan created
- ✅ Memory bank structure initialized
- ✅ Success criteria defined (Sharpe ≥ 1.2, latency ≤ 250ms, uptime 95%)
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies identified
- ✅ Deliverables checklist established

### Architecture & Design
- ✅ System architecture patterns defined
- ✅ Technology stack selected (Python + C# + NinjaTrader 8)
- ✅ Communication protocols designed (WebSocket/TCP bridge)
- ✅ Data pipeline approach planned (parquet storage, feature engineering)

### Development Setup
- ✅ Git repository `nt8-ml-mvp` created and initialized

### 🚀 **COMPLETE: Enhanced WebSocket Bridge (Week 3 Work + Innovations)**
- ✅ **Production-grade WebSocket server** (`TBOTTickWebSocketPublisherOptimized`)
- ✅ **High-performance concurrent message handling** with SemaphoreSlim and async queues
- ✅ **Historical data streaming** - up to 1.1M bars (validated with 709,887 bars real data)
- ✅ **Real-time tick and bar broadcasting** with configurable throttling
- ✅ **Advanced client management** - automatic cleanup, ping/pong monitoring
- ✅ **Thread-safe operations** using ConcurrentList and ReaderWriterLockSlim
- ✅ **Configurable performance settings** - connection limits, queue sizes, batch processing
- ✅ **JSON protocol implementation** ready for ML pipeline integration
- ✅ **Robust error handling** with graceful degradation and recovery
- ✅ **Deployment automation** with `update_indicator.sh` script

### 🧠 **NEW: Intelligent Historical Data Management**
- ✅ **Automatic bar calculation** based on timeframe and lookback period
- ✅ **Multi-timeframe support**: Minute, Second, Day charts
- ✅ **Flexible time units**: Days, Weeks, Months, Years
- ✅ **Smart detection** of chart timeframe (`BarsPeriod.BarsPeriodType`)
- ✅ **Intelligent fallback** for non-time-based charts (Tick, Volume)
- ✅ **Safety boundaries**: Min 100 bars, max user-defined limits
- ✅ **Transparent logging** showing calculation process
- ✅ **User-friendly configuration**: Business terms instead of technical bar counts

#### Configuration Examples Working:
- **30 days on 1-minute chart** → 43,200 bars calculated
- **7 days on 5-minute chart** → 2,016 bars calculated
- **3 months on daily chart** → ~90 bars calculated
- **Fallback for tick charts** → Uses HistoricalBarsCount limit

- **Business-Friendly Parameters**: Users configure in days/weeks instead of technical bar counts
- **Latency Focus**: Sub-20ms model inference critical for real-time trading
- **Data Quality**: Daily validation essential for reliable model training
- **Integration Pattern**: ✅ **Intelligent separation of concerns achieved** (data/model/bridge/execution)
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive simulation before any live capital risk
