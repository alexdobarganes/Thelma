## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Blockers
- None (project just initiated)

### Potential Risks (Monitoring)
- **Data gaps/bad ticks**: Will implement daily sanity checks and K-nearest fill
- **Model overfitting**: Walk-forward validation and early stopping planned
- **WebSocket latency spikes**: Local caching and async queue architecture ready
- **NT API changes**: Will pin NT8 version 8.1.x and implement smoke tests

## Performance Metrics (Targets)

### Trading Performance
- **Target Sharpe Ratio**: â‰¥ 1.2 on 2024-2025 out-of-sample data
- **Target Win Rate**: TBD (will establish baseline in Week 2)
- **Max Drawdown**: Target < 5%
- **Average Trade Duration**: TBD (will measure in validation)

### System Performance  
- **Signal Latency**: Target â‰¤ 250ms round-trip
- **Model Inference**: Target â‰¤ 20ms per prediction
- **System Uptime**: Target 95% during active trading hours
- **Data Processing**: Target < 50ms per bar for feature engineering

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Architecture Decisions
- **Model Selection**: TCN vs LightGBM comparison approach (data-driven choice)
- **Data Storage**: Parquet/feather for efficient time-series handling
- **Communication**: WebSocket bridge pattern for real-time signals
- **Validation**: Walk-forward testing to prevent look-ahead bias
- **Risk Management**: Progressive testing (sim â†’ micro-live â†’ full deployment)

### Key Technical Insights
- **Latency Focus**: Sub-20ms model inference critical for real-time trading
- **Data Quality**: Daily validation essential for reliable model training
- **Integration Pattern**: Separation of concerns (data/model/bridge/execution)
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive simulation before any live capital risk

## Success Tracking

### Weekly Milestone Gates
- **Week 1 Gate**: Data pipeline operational, model architecture selected
- **Week 2 Gate**: Trained model with acceptable back-test performance 
- **Week 3 Gate**: End-to-end signal generation and trade execution in simulation
- **Week 4 Gate**: Live testing complete, MVP ready for production use
